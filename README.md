## Sentiment Analysis of Films Based on Baidu Artificial Intelligence API

### Intro
Cinematic works, as one of the nine arts, have always been an essential part of people's entertainment. With the advancement of the internet, it has become easier for individuals to access high-quality works. With more cinematic works emerging, reviews have also become increasingly important as they reflect audiences' views and emotional attitudes, serving as a crucial indicator for evaluating the quality of the work. 

However, tasks of manual analysis is challenging due to the large amount and complexity of the comments, especially when some audiences make sarcastic comments based on the context. Thus natural language processing technology was born, providing an effective way to analyze comments on these works. By utilizing NLP, we gained a intuitive understanding of audience evaluations and provided valuable reference for improvement.

This project takes the recent novel adaptation "Three Bodies" whichâ€™s aired on the Chinese video website "Bilibili" as an example. We want to explore the application of NLP technology in analyzing internet film reviews, and do a further research on the logic of netizens' comments from a linguistic pragmatic functional perspective with the aid of visualization tools such as word clouds.
